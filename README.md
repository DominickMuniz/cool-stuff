## File 1: Reflected-text.html 
This is a chunk of code with some breif CSS styling to easily make it so you can display any text, ideally a header -- so that it looks like it is reflected.

## File 2: Background-animation.html
This code contains a feature to animate the background without using JS. Instead, it uses CSS-based @keyframe animation. I also added a polygon black section to contain the color-changing portion. This file also improved the text styling from File 1 because the new background color required making the text easier to read. I added some text-shadow to do so.
